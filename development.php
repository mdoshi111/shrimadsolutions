                                    <p>SAP is the world’s largest enterprise applications software company - as measured by software and service-related revenue - with 172,000 customers around the globe. Unlike many of its competitors, SAP has mostly grown organically and has just a few significant acquisitions under its belt. Much of SAP’s customer base consists of very large enterprise accounts. However, they have made significant gains in the small and medium enterprise (SME) market with their Business All-in-One, Business ByDesign and Business One product lines.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    SAP offers a wide range of enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications including customer relationship management (CRM), financial management, human capital management, product lifecycle management, and supply chain management. They also have a large network of partners (i.e. the SAP Ecosystem) that provide unique integration and customization offerings for specific markets. For example, Et Alia has developed CREW All-in-One for the construction industry, which is built on SAP Business All-in-One.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    In addition to its ERP products, SAP offers several business analytics applications as part of its BusinessObjects product line. BusinessObjects is one of SAP’s more notable acquisitions which was announced back in 2007. This acquisition pushed SAP into the business intelligence (BI) leaders circle with IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. They are reinforcing their position with recent innovations such as SAP HANA, their in-memory technology that allows organizations to run queries from multiple data sources in real time.
